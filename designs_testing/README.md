# Welcome to the building blocks
Each project needs fundamental building blocks, this is no exception.
The proposed elements for the MOSbius chip is shown below.

![Mosbius Proposal](/proposal/mosbius_proposal.png)

The proposal contains:
- 7 Synapses
- 7 subthreshold Neuron (AH model)
- 1 subthreshold Neuron (LIF model)
- 1 Neuron (LIF model)
- 65x10 switch matrix
    - D type Flip-flops with non overlaping clock
    - Transmission gates

# We have components
On this md file will be described the blocks that are proposed, the characteristics and details
